\section{IMU pre-integration in $S^3$ and SO(3)}
\label{sec:imu}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Overview}

Due to the different rates of IMU data and keyframe creations, hundreds of IMU measurements need to be integrated to generate a motion factor linking two consecutive keyframes. 
In addition to that, the integration of the motion equations in an absolute reference frame strongly depends on the initial conditions of orientation, velocity and IMU bias.
Therefore, the changes in the estimates of these magnitudes (inherent to the iterative nature of the optimization) affect the whole motion integral. 
Delta pre-integration theory was developed to avoid the need of re-integrating all IMU data at each iteration \cite{LUPTON-09,forster2015imu}. 
On the one hand, this theory defines new motion magnitudes called \emph{deltas}, which are independent of the initial conditions for orientation and velocity, and thus depend \emph{only} on the IMU data and bias. 
On the other hand, the effect of the changes in the bias estimates is linearized so that the deltas can be corrected a posteriori, 
\ie, when computing the residual, 
using pre-computed Jacobians. 

In this section, we revise the IMU pre-integration theory, providing three contributions: 
1) a segmentation of the computation pipeline (from measurements, to body magnitudes, to the current delta, and to the integrated delta); 
2) a physical interpretation of the delta magnitudes; 
and 
3) a simpler yet rigorous algebraic approach, valid for both the $S^3$~(quaternion) and SO(3) (rotation matrix) manifolds, which takes profit of the pipeline segmentation and the chain rule to compute the otherwise cumbersome Jacobians \cite{forster2015imu}. 
Important complements are provided in \appRef{sec:derivatives_SO3} for the sake of background and completeness.

\subsection{Quaternion rotations}

We define the quaternion-by-vector product $\od$ so that
%
\begin{align}
\bfq\od\bfv \te \bfq\ot\bfv\ot\bfq^*
~,
\end{align}
%
where $\bfq^*$ denotes the dual quaternion of $\bfq$. 
The symbol $\ot$ stands for the product of quaternions and $\od$ corresponds to the quaternion-by-vector which performs a 3D rotation of an input vector $\bfv$. 
Notice that if $\bfR$ is the rotation matrix equivalent to the quaternion $\bfq$, then 
%
$\bfq\od\bfv = \bfR\,\bfv$. 
%
This straightforward equivalence
enables us to define all the forthcoming IMU pre-integration algebra in a way that allows a direct transcription between the $S^3$  and $SO(3)$ spaces of representation.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{State integration in the absolute reference frame}

We define the world-referenced states of the IMU by \mbox{$\bfx\!=\!(\bfp,\bfv,\bfq)$} where $\bfp$ stands for the position, $\bfv$ for the velocity and $\bfq$ for the orientation encoded as a quaternion.
The time evolution of $\bfx$ is governed by the kinematic equation,
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:cont_basic}
\begin{split}
\dot\bfp &= \bfv \\
\dot\bfv &= \bfg + \bfq\od\bfa \\
\dot\bfq &= \frac12\bfq\ot\bw 
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
where $\bfg$ denotes the gravity vector and we identify $\bfb=(\bfa,\bw)$ as the \emph{body magnitudes}, that is, the magnitudes of acceleration and angular velocity measured by the IMU and expressed in its reference frame. These body magnitudes are obtained at discrete times $t_j$ from biased and noisy IMU measurements, \ie,
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:body}
\begin{split}
\bfa_j &\te \bfa_{m,j} - \bfa_{b,j} - \bfa_n \\
\bw_j  &\te \bw_{m,j}  - \bw_{b,j}  - \bw_n 
~,
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
with $\bullet_m$ the measurements, $\bullet_b$ the biases, and $\bullet_n$ the noises.
Assuming constant body magnitudes within the IMU sampling period $\dt\te t_k-t_j$, we have the discrete-time relation:
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:integration_state}
\begin{split}
\bfp_{k} &= \bfp_j + \bfv_j\dt  + \frac12\bfg\dt^2 + \frac12\bfq_j\od\bfa_j\dt^2 \\
\bfv_{k} &= \bfv_j + \bfg\dt + \bfq_j\odot\bfa_j\dt \\
\bfq_{k} &= \bfq_j\ot\Exp(\bw_j\dt/2) 
\end{split}
\end{align}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Delta definitions}

Consider a non-rotating reference frame that is free-falling at the acceleration of gravity $\bfg$, and name it $\cG_t$. 
An ideal (unbiased and noiseless) IMU glued to this frame would measure null linear accelerations and angular velocities. 
Any non-null measurements would be due to a relative motion of the IMU \wrt  $\cG_t$.

At a given keyframe instant $t_i$, we initialize $\cG_i$ at \mbox{$\bfx_i=(\bfp_i,\bfv_i,\bfq_i)$}.
At a later keyframe instant $t_j$ $(j > i)$,  $\cG_j$ has fallen according to $\bfg$, and the state of our moving body is now at $\bfx_j=(\bfp_j,\bfv_j,\bfq_j)$.
The motion variation, denoted $\D_{ij}$, is defined as the state variation in position, velocity and orientation of our body between $\cG_i$ and  $\cG_j$, that is,
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:delta_definition}
\begin{split}
\Dp_{ij} &= \bfq_i^*\od\Big(\bfp_j - \bfp_i - \bfv_i\Dt_{ij} - \frac12\bfg\Dt_{ij}^2\Big) \\
\Dv_{ij} &= \bfq_i^*\od(\bfv_j - \bfv_i - \bfg\Dt_{ij}) \\
\Dq_{ij} &= \bfq_i^*\ot\bfq_j 
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
where $\Dt_{ij} \te t_j - t_i$ is the time duration between the two keyframes. 
Notice that this definition of $\D_{ij}$ is the same as provided in~\cite{LUPTON-09,forster2015imu}, and we have given it here a clear physical meaning.
It is worth to notice that the deltas form a group under the composition law $\D_{ik}\te\D_{ij}\oplus\D_{jk}$, defined by:
%
\begin{align} \label{equ:composition}
\begin{split}
\Dp_{ik} 
&= \Dp_{ij} + \Dv_{ij}\Dt_{jk} + \Dq_{ij}\od\Dp_{jk} \\
\Dv_{ik} 
&= \Dv_{ij} + \Dq_{ij}\od\Dv_{jk} \\
\Dq_{ik} 
&= \Dq_{ij}\ot\Dq_{jk} 
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
with identity $\D_0=[(0,0,0),(0,0,0),(1,0,0,0)]$, and inverse $\D_{ji}\te\D_{ij}\inv$ shuch that $\D\inv\op\D=\D\oplus\D\inv=\D_0$ (the inverse expression is not given for space reasons).
At any time $j$ we can recover the state estimate $\bfx_j$ from the state estimate $\bfx_i$ and the motion delta $\D_{ij}$:
%
\begin{align} \label{equ:reconstruction}
\begin{split}
\bfp_j &= \bfp_i + \bfv_i\Dt_{ij} + \frac12\bfg\Dt_{ij}^2 + \bfq_i\od\Dp_{ij} \\
\bfv_j &= \bfv_i + \bfg\Dt_{ij} + \bfq_i\od\Dv_{ij} \\
\bfq_j &= \bfq_i\ot\Dq_{ij}   
\end{split}
\end{align}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Incremental delta pre-integration}

Substituting the integration Eq.~\eqRef{equ:integration_state} in the delta definitions \eqRef{equ:delta_definition}, we obtain the incremental delta pre-integration,
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:g_second_order_pre-integration}
\begin{split}
\Dp_{ik} 
&= \Dp_{ij} + \Dv_{ij}\dt + \frac12\Dq_{ij}\od\bfa_j\dt^2 \\
\Dv_{ik} 
&= \Dv_{ij} + \Dq_{ij}\od\bfa_j\dt \\
\Dq_{ik} 
&= \Dq_{ij}\ot\Exp(\bw_j\dt) 
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
%being $t_i$ the time of the last KF,
%at which
with $\D_{ii}=\D_0$.
Interestingly, \eqRef{equ:g_second_order_pre-integration} is analogous to the motion of a body \emph{in an inertial frame} under constant acceleration and rotation rate.
Notice that by letting the reference frame fall with gravity, we get rid of the dependence on gravity in the integration equations, and only the body magnitudes drive  the integral.
Indeed, we can define a proper delta $\delta_{jk}$ from the current body magnitudes $\bfb_j=(\bfa_j,\bw_j) \te \bfb_{m,i} - \bfb_{b,j} - \bfb_{n,j}$ at time $t_j$,
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:delta_creation}
\begin{split}
\dpp_{jk} &= \frac12\bfa_j\dt^2 \\
\dv_{jk} &= \bfa_j\dt \\
\dq_{jk} &= \Exp(\bw_j\dt)
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
%(notice that $\bfb_{b,j}=\bfb_{b,i}$) 
and write the integration \eqRef{equ:g_second_order_pre-integration} as the composition 
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:composition_compact}
\D_{ik}=\D_{ij}\oplus\delta_{jk}
\end{align}
%
described in \eqRef{equ:composition}. 
Typically, we take the biases at the keyframe time $t_i$, that is, $\bfb_{b,j} = \bfb_{b,i}$.
In the following, we will identify $\D$ with the pre-integrated delta, and $\delta$ with the current delta.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Jacobians}

\newcommand{\jac}[2]{{\bfJ^{#1}_{#2}}}

%Notation: 
We note all Jacobians with $\jac{y}{x}\te\dparil{y}{x}$ and refer the reader to \appRef{sec:derivatives_SO3} for details on the development of all non-trivial Jacobian blocks in this section.



\subsubsection{Jacobians of the body magnitudes}

from  Eq.~\eqRef{equ:body} we have:
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:jac_body}
\jac{\bfb}{\bfb_m}&=\bfI_6 & \jac{\bfb}{\bfb_b}&=-\bfI_6 & \jac{\bfb}{\bfb_n}&=-\bfI_6
~.
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Jacobians of the current delta}
\label{sec:jac_data}

We have from \eqRef{equ:delta_creation},
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:jac_current_delta}
\jac{\delta_{jk}}{\bfb_j} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac12\bfI\dt^2 	& \bf0 \\
\bfI\dt 			& \bf0 \\
\bf0 	          & \bfJ_r(\bw_j\dt)\dt
\end{bmatrix} 
\in \bbR^{9\tcross6}
\end{align}
%
where we develop the lower-right block as in \appRef{sec:jac_R3toSO3}.





\subsubsection{Jacobians of the delta composition}

We differentiate the delta composition \eqRef{equ:composition_compact} described in \eqRef{equ:composition},
%
\begin{subequations}\label{equ:jac_composition}
\begin{align}
\jac{\D_{ik}}{\D_{ij}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
\bfI  & \bfI\dt & - \DR_{ij}  \hatx{\dpp_{jk}}  \\
\bf0  & \bfI    & - \DR_{ij}  \hatx{\dv_{jk}} \\
\bf0  & \bf0    &   \dR_{jk}\tr 
\end{bmatrix} 
\in \bbR^{9\tcross9}
\\
\jac{\D_{ik}}{\delta_{jk}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
\DR_{ij} & \bf0     & \bf0 \\
\bf0     & \DR_{ij} & \bf0 \\
\bf0     & \bf0     & \bfI  
\end{bmatrix}
~~~~~~~~~\in \bbR^{9\tcross9}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
where $\DR_{ij}$ and $\dR_{jk}$ are the rotation matrix deltas corresponding to the respective quaternion deltas $\Dq_{ij}$ and $\dq_{jk}$. 
We develop all the non-trivial blocks as in \appRef{sec:jac_SO3xR3toR3} and \appRef{sec:jac_SO3xSO3toSO3}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Incremental delta covariance integration}

Let $\bfQ_\D$ be the covariance of the pre-integrated delta, and $\bfQ_n$ the one of the measurement noise. For convenience, we first compute the covariance of the current delta,
%
\begin{align}
\bfQ_\delta =  \jac{\delta}{\bfb_n}\bfQ_n\,\jac{\delta}{\bfb_n}\tr
~,
\end{align}
%
where $\jac{\delta}{\bfb_n} = \jac{\delta}{\bfb} \cdot \jac{\bfb}{\bfb_n}
$ is the noise Jacobian, obtained with \eqsRef{equ:jac_body}{equ:jac_current_delta} and the chain rule.
The delta covariance is then integrated with
%
\begin{align}
\bfQ_{\D_{ik}} = \jac{\D_{ik}}{\D_{ij}}\bfQ_{\D_{ij}}\,\jac{\D_{ik}}{\D_{ij}}\tr + \jac{\D_{ik}}{\delta_{jk}}\bfQ_\delta\,\jac{\D_{ik}}{\delta_{jk}}\tr
~,
\end{align}
%
using Jacobians \eqRef{equ:jac_composition}, and starting at $\bfQ_{\D_{ii}}={\bf0}_{9\tcross9}$.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Delta correction with new bias}

Let $\ol\D$ and $\ol{\bfb_b}$ be respectively the pre-integrated delta and the bias values used during pre-integration. Since the bias estimates change at each iteration of the optimizer, we need to update the delta according to the new bias values $\bfb_b$. We do so with the linearized update,
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:delta_correction}
\D = \ol\D + \jac{\D}{\bfb_b}(\bfb_b - \ol{\bfb_b})
~,
\end{align}
%
where $\jac{\D}{\bfb_b}$ is the pre-integrated bias Jacobian, computed incrementally using also the chain rule,
%
\begin{align}
\jac{\D_{ik}}{\bfb_b} 
= \jac{\D_{ik}}{\D_{ij}}\jac{\D_{ij}}{\bfb_b} 
- \jac{\D_{ik}}{\delta_{jk}}\jac{\delta_{jk}}{\bfb_b}
~.
\end{align}
%
with 
$
\jac{\delta_{jk}}{\bfb_b}=\jac{\delta_{jk}}{\bfb} \jac{\bfb}{\bfb_b}
$.
%
This Jacobian starts at $\jac{\D_{ii}}{\bfb_b} = {\bf0}_{9\tcross 9}$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Residuals}

The computation of the residuals for the IMU delta factors (see \figRef{fig:factor_graph}, green) requires: the state estimates $\bfx_i$ and $\bfx_j$; the current bias estimates $\bfb_{b,i}$; the pre-integrated delta $\ol{\D_{ij}}$; the bias used during pre-integration $\ol{\bfb_{b,i}}$; and the pre-integrated bias Jacobian $\jac{\D_{ij}}{\bfb_b}$. The process is best understood if split into smaller steps: we first compute a corrected delta $\D_{ij}$ using \eqRef{equ:delta_correction}; then we compute a predicted delta $\widehat\D_{ij}$ using \eqRef{equ:delta_definition}; and finally we compute the residual with
%
\begin{align}\label{equ:imu_residual}
\bfr(\bfx_i,\bfx_j,\bfb_{b,i}) 
= \begin{bmatrix}
\Dp_{ij}-\widehat\Dp_{ij} \\
\Dv_{ij}-\widehat\Dv_{ij} \\
\Log(\widehat\Dq_{ij}^*\ot\Dq_{ij})
\end{bmatrix} 
\in \bbR^9
~.
\end{align}
%
Its information matrix is given by $\bfOmega=\bfQ_{\D ik}\inv$.
