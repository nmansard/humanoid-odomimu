In this paper, a graphical representation approach is presented to integrate 
IMU measurement on an augmented human. Although state estimators using both
informations \cite{Johnson:jof:2016,Fallon:ichr:2014} have been already proposed, this method has several additional interests.
First it is allowing to estimate bias and initial position of the IMU thanks to the graph
approach. Second the concept has been extensively used in the SLAM community and integrating 
other measurements such as laser, range image and so on can be done in a coherent mathematical framework.
The technical difficulty is to handle the size of the graph such that it is tractable in a limited window.
It was proposed in \cite{forster2015imu} to pre-integrate the most frequent data which are given by the IMU.
In this paper we propose a detailed derivation of this pre-integration using quaternion instead
of rotation matrices leading not only to faster computation and smaller memory foot-print,
but also to a more comprehensible pre-integration data to which we can give a physically coherent interpretation.
We validate these concepts by estimating the trajectory of the foot of a human agent during walking,
and show that we are able to reconstruct its trajectory under some conditions.
