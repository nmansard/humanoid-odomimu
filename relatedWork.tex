\section{Related work}\label{sec:relatedWork}

Person localization using a foot-mounted IMU was first introduced in \cite{hutchings1998system}. 
%Since then, many developments have been made to find alternative ways to accurately localize people.
Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) methods (aka Personal Navigation Devices), make use of one or more IMU installed on the body of the subject.
The main idea of PDR techniques is to integrate inertial measurements with Zero Velocity Update constraints to reduce errors \cite{ojeda2007personal}.
This work is extensively used in IMU-based human localization works and various fields~\cite{kwanmuang2015phd} analyses the gait of a walking person 
with PDR method to estimate the direction of the shoe, thus the walking direction, and measure stride length. In \cite{jin2011robust}, multiple dead-reckoning systems on a single human
are used along with constraints on relative displacements. This greatly reduce errors when compared to a traditional dead-reckoning method. 
One way to understand why foot-mounted IMU is preferred to other alternatives may be given by \cite{groves2007inertial} comparing body-mounted and foot-mounted based PDR methods. 
Both systems had similar performances considering the position error, being lower than 10 m for 60 seconds experiments. However, the foot-mounted shown drifts as results were compared
to GPS ground truth. Body-mounted method proved to be usable in walking, running or jumping test cases.

%% Various strategies can be considered to improve the localization results of foot-mounted IMU navigation.
%% To achieve this goal, one way to consider is the use of one or more IMU and define some special constraints.
%% The main advantage of this choice is that the solution would be easily wearable and thus usable.

PDR can be used to recognize the action being carried out by the pedestrian through classification methods, but adding this contextual information is also a way to reduce PDR localization errors~\cite{kourogi2010method,panahandeh2012chest}. 
Contextual information can be added by training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using IMU data~\cite{wagstaff2017improving}.
Other prior information can be exploited when merging the measurements of several IMUs, for example relative to the maximum step length the pedestrian could do when using two foot-mounted IMUs~\cite{skog2012fusing}.

Fusion strategies with information coming from different sensors can also be used to improve localization results as it is already done
for in robotics: GPS information~\cite{sukkarieh1999high,hide2012investigating,gao2014data}, received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from wireless communication~\cite{malyavej2013indoor} using wireless local area networks (WLAN) or radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags placed at known locations~\cite{ruiz2012accurate}
along with other drift reduction methods such as zero velocity updates (ZUPTs), zero angular-rate updates (ZARU) and the use of magnetometers.
Using these strategies might be a successful solution to overcome the drift observed in methods using IMU and to obtain positioning errors of approximately 1.5 m~\cite{ruiz2012accurate}.
In \cite{chdid2011inertial}, a foot-mounted IMU is fused with a waist-mounted visual odometry system to update the state of the system composed of its position, velocity and acceleration.
This last system was used recently~\cite{pierce2016incorporation} to design a fusion strategy requiring measurements only once per human step instead of every time step.

More information can be structured into a map following a SLAM approach~\cite{angermann2012footslam}, leading to a bounded error growth to 1 meter. This FootSLAM uses dynamic Bayesian network and loop-closure strategies.
The idea exploited here is to use the normal human behavior 
consisting on relying on visual information to guide the motion and avoid obstacles. FootSLAM gave birth to several variants for use in different conditions or slightly different purposes~\cite{puyol2012complexity,bruno2011wislam}.
Body-mounted IMUs with a FastSLAM-base implementation (ActionSLAM) was then proposed, with landmarks being location-related actions~\cite{hardegger2012actionslam}. 
A foot-mounted IMU is used for inertial navigation purposes \emph{and} as a landmark observation system (through action recognition strategies using a trained classifier).
%ActionSLAM considers that some specific actions are done only at some specific locations on the map. Results tend to show that using both foot-mounted and wrist-mounted IMUs
%is giving results that are robust enough for indoor applications.

%Previously cited example tend to show how important it is for pedestrian inertial navigation system to be able to deal with the localization drifts due to the integration of IMU's data. 
%Two different methods have been aforementionned to reach this goal : fusion strategies using different complementary sensors and IMU only based methods using specificities
%of human behavior (walking patterns, action recognition, contextual information).

From this analysis, we see that two important aspects have been investigated to solve pedestrian localization: i) exploiting some specificities of human behavior with the inertial measurements as prior knowledge and ii) fusing IMU with additional complementary sensors.
In this paper, we have shown that using a graphical model is a sane and efficient way to encode prior knowledge about the human behavior (horizontal foot during zero-velocity phases).
While we are not exploiting any absolute measurement, the drift resulting of the odometry integration is contained to some reasonable margin (i.e. comparable to the accuracy obtained when a rough map is used).
An additional feature of our approach is that it is easy to extend the graphical model, either with additional prior knowledge, or with measurements coming from additional sensors.
For example, fusing absolute but noisy measurements like GPS, RFID or RSSI would be straight forward.
