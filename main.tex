\input{abstract}
%% In this paper, a graphical representation approach is presented to integrate 
%% IMU measurement and kinematic information on a humanoid robot. Although state estimators using both
%% informations \cite{Johnson:jof:2016,Fallon:ichr:2014} have been already proposed, this method has several additional interests.
%% First it is allowing to estimate bias and initial position of the IMU thanks to the graph
%% approach. Second the concept has been extensively used in the SLAM community and integrating 
%% other measurements such as laser, range image and so on can be done in a coherent mathematical framework.
%% The technical difficulty is to handle the size of the graph such that it is tractable in a limited window.
%% \cite{forster2015imu} proposed to pre-integrate the most frequent data which are given by the IMU.
%% In this paper we propose a detailed derivation of this pre-integration using quaternion instead
%% of rotation matrices leading to faster computation and smaller memory foot-print.
%% The algorithm is tested on the HRP-2 humanoid robot to estimate
%% its flying foot trajectory and validated against motion capture data.
