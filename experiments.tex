\section{Experiments} \label{sec:experiments}

Trajectory estimation is naturally more effective with the use of a good IMU. IMU technology is advanced at such point that 
one can find those systems for a range of price going from low cost to thousands of dollars for space-navigation or military purposes.
The performances of an IMU are caracterized by several factors from which we can mainly cite biases random walk and noises standard deviation
as examples.

We chose to use a low-cost IMU in our application to realize the feasability of our method. For this purpose we selected the 
MPU6050 from invensense combining both an accelerometer and a gyroscope and extensively used in the open source community.

Several experiments were designed to check that the trajectory estimation is feasible.
